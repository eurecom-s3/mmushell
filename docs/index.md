This site contains the project documentation for the
`mmushell` project, an OS-Agnostic memory morensics tool, a proof of concept for techniques developed by Andrea Oliveri and Davide Balzarotti in ["In the Land of MMUs: Multiarchitecture OS-Agnostic Virtual Memory Forensics"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3528102).

## Table of contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference/reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)
